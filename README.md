# SIT774 10.4HD: Awesome Website Features

This project is created for the High Distinction task **10.4HD** of the Deakin University unit **SIT774: Web Technologies and Development**.

## Brief Introduction and Overview

In this web demo, I extended the validation functionality of the registration form. Now I can customize the username and password requirements as I wish. This is important because, for example, some real-world websites do not require both uppercase and lowercase letters in a password, while others do.
I also used JavaScript functions to make the validation visually dynamic within the form.
Next, I used the bcrypt module to hash the entered password and stored it locally using sqlite3 as a file-based database.
In the tutorial section on the left side of the page, I added interactive elements to help users better understand how the related technologies work.
Finally, I customized the CSS and tailored Bootstrap to make the page look cool—for example, with a gradient background, animated hover effects on buttons, and modified form input borders.
